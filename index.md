##SUMMARY

Passionate about digital technologies (hardware and software) since my beginnings in sales at Future Shop, my studies in marketing and e-commerce have allowed me to transform this passion into an expertise that I have the chance to apply on a daily basis with clients from all sectors. My endless curiosity, my sense of leadership and my human values ​​are the engines that motivate me behind the projects I undertake. I consider that my teamwork abilities, my interpersonal skills and my ease with pedagogy are key factors in the success of my work.
